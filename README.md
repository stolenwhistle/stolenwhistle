PROFILE

I have nearly ten years of experience in Search Engine Evaluation & Artificial Intelligence and fifteen years in the Environmental Consulting field. I have recently completed a Business Intelligence Analytics (BIA) Bootcamp so that I may pivot into data analysis. My past experience in collection, evaluation and reporting of data and recent training in BIA make me a qualified candidate for a positions in BIA. 

I have recently completed several projects during my training with TripleTen including a Final Project to analyze Zomato.com data.
